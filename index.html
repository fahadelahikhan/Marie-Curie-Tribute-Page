                <p>Marie Curie (1867-1934) was a Polish-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields, and the only person to achieve this distinction in the related fields of physics and chemistry.</p>

                <p>Born Maria Salomea Skłodowska in Warsaw, Poland, she moved to Paris to pursue her education at the Sorbonne, where she earned degrees in physics and mathematics. Her marriage to Pierre Curie led to a remarkable scientific partnership that would revolutionize our understanding of atomic structure and radioactive elements.</p>
